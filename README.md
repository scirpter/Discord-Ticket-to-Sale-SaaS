# Ticket-to-Sale SaaS

Multi-tenant Discord bot + web dashboard for ticket-based sales with WooCommerce and Voodoo Pay payment confirmation.

## Stack

- Node.js `24.13.0`
- `discord.js@14.25.1`
- `next@16.1.6`
- MySQL + Drizzle ORM
- zod + neverthrow + pino + p-retry + p-queue + ulid

## Workspace Layout

- `apps/web-app`: Next.js dashboard + REST/webhook API routes.
- `apps/bot-worker`: Discord interaction worker with `/sale`, `/points`, and component/modal flows.
- `packages/core`: shared domain/config/security/services/repositories.
- `drizzle/migrations`: SQL migrations.

## Required Environment

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`
- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`
- `DATABASE_URL`

Recommended for production:

- `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI`
- `SESSION_SECRET`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `CHECKOUT_SIGNING_SECRET`
- `SUPER_ADMIN_DISCORD_IDS`
- `BOT_PUBLIC_URL`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values.

## Commands

- Install: `pnpm install`
- Bootstrap: `pnpm run setup`
- Dev: `pnpm dev`
- Lint: `pnpm lint --fix`
- Typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`
- Tests: `pnpm test --coverage`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Migrate: `pnpm migrate`
- Deploy slash commands: `pnpm deploy:commands`

## OAuth + Dashboard

- Login endpoint: `GET /api/auth/discord/login`
- Callback endpoint: `GET /api/auth/discord/callback`
- Dashboard page: `/dashboard`
- Dashboard now loads Discord servers from OAuth (manage-server capable guilds), auto-checks bot installation, and auto-links selected server to workspace.
- A Discord server is now bound to exactly one workspace at a time; reconnecting a server moves it to the current workspace mapping.
- Server settings now use Discord channel/role selectors instead of manual ID fields.
- Server settings now include a `tip enabled` toggle (ask customer for optional GBP tip before checkout link generation).
- Server settings now include rewards configuration:
  - `point value` (minor currency based)
  - categories that `earn` points
  - categories where points can be `redeemed`
  - categories eligible for `referral rewards`
  - `referral reward` GBP fallback amount (used only when eligible purchased variants have no per-variant referral reward)
  - `referral log channel` (optional)
  - `referral thank-you template` for DM placeholders
- Product variants now support per-variant referral reward amounts in the product builder.
- Dashboard now includes customer points management (list balances, manual add/remove, search).
- Workspace deletion is available from dashboard for owner/super-admin cleanup.
- Coupons can be created, edited, and deleted per server from dashboard (`code`, fixed discount amount, active flag).
- Dashboard resolves the linked workspace for a selected Discord server before loading server settings.

## Ticket Sale Flow

- Staff runs `/sale` in any server channel where they have required permissions.
- Bot shows category -> product -> variant flow with Back buttons on selection steps.
- After variant selection, bot supports basket flow (`Add More Products` or continue).
- Coupon step is optional; entered code is validated against server coupon settings.
- Product description is shown in the bot flow when configured.
- Bot gathers custom form answers through modals.
- Optional tip prompt (yes/no) can be enabled per server; yes-path collects custom GBP tip amount.
- Email is now a mandatory system question (always first, always required) for all category form sets.
- Before checkout creation, bot checks customer points by email and prompts to use points when redeemable points are available.
- Members can submit referrals via `/refer` (referrer email + new customer email).
- Points are reserved at checkout creation and only deducted after successful payment confirmation.
- Paid confirmation message now includes updated points balance.
- Referral rewards are auto-granted on first paid order for claimed customer emails, using category eligibility + purchased variant reward snapshots.
- Bot creates `order_session` and sends a direct checkout hyperlink message in the ticket (`Click here to pay`).
- Checkout amount now reflects basket total minus coupon plus tip.
- If Voodoo Pay multi-provider integration is configured, checkout uses hosted `pay.php` provider-selection mode.
- Checkout URL now always includes the `email` query parameter (from answers, or a safe fallback email when missing).
- Voodoo Pay callbacks accept query/form/json payloads, and paid logs fall back to the ticket channel if paid-log channel delivery fails.
- Woo webhook confirms payment (`processing`/`completed`).
- Voodoo Pay callback endpoint can also finalize paid orders.
- API verifies signature, dedupes, retries on failure, fetches Woo order notes.
- Bot posts paid-order details to configured paid-log channel (sensitive fields masked).

## Points Command

- `/points email:<address>` returns store-scoped points balance for that email.
- Response is ephemeral so only the requester can see it, even in public channels.
- Points are scoped to the connected workspace + Discord server (no cross-merchant sharing).

## Referral Command

- `/refer` opens an ephemeral modal for:
  - your email
  - new customer email
- First valid referral claim for a customer email wins.
- Owner/staff can monitor submission and payout outcomes via referral log channel.

## Security Notes

- Super-admin can rotate global bot token from dashboard API.
- All tenant data is scoped by `tenant_id`.
- Webhook payload and audit events are persisted for operational review.
